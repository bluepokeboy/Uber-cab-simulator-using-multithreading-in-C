# Uber-cab-simulator-using-multithreading-in-C
Uber cab simulator in C programming language using multithreading.        
Each cab, customer and server is programmed as a thread running on a common code.     
To run the code use the following commands -        
> gcc Q3.c -pthread       
> ./a.out       
> number_of_cabs number_of_riders number_of_servers  

A simulation will now run.    
Runs on Linux.
